#train to perfect recall
maybe something like a random order mix of 50% targets and 50% drawn 
form or word pool until they do two perfect runs through the set,
 then one list of 20 half targets half not at the end? 

300 trials
3 cant be PM
297 - 1 PM trial every 10 ongoing 

x 8 = 2400 total trials

8 PM targets versus 1 PM target, so 18 
stimuli reserved for PM
